When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It would be helpful when we want to save a copy to cloud. It would prevent the loss 
in case something happens to local computer. It would also be helpful in sharing the 
code with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It's the same with other features as well. Git automatically pulling the changes might
not be desired. It may results in too frequent pull requests which may be unnecessary.
There could be case when many contributors are working on the code and we might not be
aware of all changes in the on the remote. If git automatically updates the local code
we would be surprised to see the changes and it may add confusion. If we choose to 
pull when we need we would be prepared mentally for the changes and it may not be as
confusing as the previous case.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?
Cloning is making the copy of repo on GitHub to local computer.
Forking is cloning, but instead of making copy of repo on the local computer, it is
made on GitHub directly.
Branches happen on a single repository. They are not a copy but an extension.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It helps keep track of the progress of code. We know how much we have diverged from the 
remote. It would take less time to update the remote if the local is updated. It gives the
flexibility of working ofline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Version control and collabration would be very hard without using Git or GitHub. If I would wish to
collaborate it would be done by communication with the collaborators and file sharing but as I mentioned
earlier, it would be harder.
