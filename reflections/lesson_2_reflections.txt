What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a Git directory in the repository which store meta-data about the 
directory basically to track the history of the files. The git directory is
hidden.
We need to do it to start keeping track of the versions. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a virtual area where we can put our files before we push them to
repo. It provides a place to put aggregate files before sending them to repo.
Also I think, if multiple users are working on same file they can compare the
code and select which changes to commit. It's not the same as working directory.
